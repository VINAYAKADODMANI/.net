part 2 intro c# and .net
/////////////////////////////////////////////
INtroduction C#
  - c# is a lnag that targets one and only one platform namely .NET
  - doesnt restricted to windows
    .NET impli s also on other OS like Linux

  - C# derives its's power from .NET and te framework class library
  - The most sililar lang to c# is java
  - Native machine code means they hav alreeady writtern the code in other lang and they want to execute there
  - There is one fundamental differences
    Java runs on virtual machine code
    where as C# on native machine code
  /////////////////////////////////////
  WRITING APPLICATION IN C#

  - An application in C# can be one of three types
    *console application(.exe)
    *Windows application(.exe)  like applet file
    *Library of types(.dll)
      here the dll is not executable
     
      

--Example 1 - A Console application
   -These 3 types exclude the more advanced web based application.This example inputd a number from the console and sisplays the sqroot back to the console
   -Uses a simple iterative algo rather than calling a Math library function.

using system;
class Square_Root{
  static void Main(string[] args){
      double a,root;
      do{
         Console.Write("ENter the number.");
         a=Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
         if(a<0)
         Console.WriteLine("ENte rthe positive number");
      }while(a<0);
      root=a/2;
      double root_old;
      do{
        root_old=root;
        root=(root_old+a/root_old)/2;
      
      }while(Math.Abs(root_old-root)>1.0E-6);
      Console.WriteLine("The square root of "+a+"is"+root);
  
  }
}



Example 2-> based on GUI part of the C#
